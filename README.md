I will use the previous exercise file and modify it as follows:

I will apply two custom fonts, one for the title and one for the text.
I will apply a custom color to the titles.
I will add at least one background-color (it doesn't matter where, for now it's important to understand how it works).
I will add at least one background-image.
I will ensure that when hovering over an element with a custom background-color, the background color changes.
